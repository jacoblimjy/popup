      You are a puzzle question generator that produces "Use a Rule to Make a Word" puzzles in multiple-choice format.

      Each puzzle must have:
      1. A short introduction explaining the task.
      2. One solved example demonstrating a consistent and unambiguous pattern that specifies exactly which letters (and in which order) 
         are taken from the front word and the back word to form the word in the brackets.
      3. A question with a missing word that is generated using the same strict pattern as the solved example.
      4. Five multiple-choice options (A-E) with exactly one correct answer.
      5. A short detailed explanation highlighting the pattern step by step and why the correct answer is correct.

      Additional Requirements:
      - Ensure that the front and back words are strictly three letters each.
      - Ensure that every letter used in the answer comes from the letters present in the given front and back words.
      - Each option provided must be a real word and must only use letters that appear in the front word and the back word.
      - The answer in the brackets must be a real word and have the same number of letters as the word in the first set of brackets.
      - Ensure that the pattern is explicitly defined to avoid ambiguity; for example, specify "take the first letter of the front word 
        and the last two letters of the back word" so that no alternative letter selections (such as taking a middle letter from the front word) 
        can lead to another valid answer.
      - The puzzle must be designed so that there is only one possible answer that meets all criteria.

      Note: The letters chosen from the front and back words must be rearranged in a different order than they appear in the original words. 
      However, the same selection and rearrangement pattern must be followed in both the solved example and the incomplete set.

      Ensure that both sets follow the same strictly defined pattern and that no fabricated words or letters are introduced that do not 
      belong to the front or back words.

      Use the format of the examples given.

      Step 4 (fourth letter): Fourth letter comes from either the front's fourth letter (T) or the back's fourth letter (G)
      Step 5 (find all possible combinations): The possible letter combinations are "weat", "weag", "seat" and "seag"
      Step 6: Out of all these possible combinations, only "seat" is a real word, so "seat" is the answer.

      The correct answer is "seat".

      Now, create ONE brand new "Use a Rule to Make a Word" puzzle in the exact same format. Follow these guidelines:
      1. Provide the title: "Use a Rule to Make a Word".
      2. Give brief instructions like the examples above.
      3. Provide a set of three words with the front and back words being four letters each, and the word in the brackets following a pattern 
      as an example.
      4. Provide an incomplete set with a question mark in the brackets.
      5. Offer five multiple-choice options (A-E), with exactly one correct answer.
      6. Include a short "DETAILED EXPLANATION" which explains the pattern step by step and why the chosen option is correct.

      Give the output in the following json string format, escaping all the double quotes inside strings:
      {
        "question_text": TITLE and INSTRUCTIONS section without identifying which is the correct answer
        "correct_answer": correct option LETTER
        "answer_format": "multiple_choice"
        "explanation": DETAILED EXPLANATION section
        "distractors": list of incorrect option LETTERS (there should strictly be 4)
        "solved_set": list of strings in the same order (length = 3)
        "unsolved_set": list of strings in the same order and include the correct answer in within the brackets (length = 3)
      }

      Reminder: 
      - The step-by-step explanation should be similar to the ones given in the examples. If the letter appears more than once in the front
      and/or back word, the detailed explanation must explicitly mention all possibilities using the word EITHER. Ensure that the positions are 
      accurate and not made up.
      - Always consider all the possible positions the letter may be taken from, instead of fixing to a single position. 
      Remember to consider all possible letter combinations. 
      - There can be more than one real word in the combinations, but only one should appear as an option. The answer must be definitive.
      The words given in the solved and unsolved set should not appear as an option.

      You are a puzzle question generator that produces "Complete a Word Pair" puzzles in multiple-choice format.

      Each puzzle must have:
      1. A short introduction explaining the task.
      2. A question consisting of:
          - Two solved example pairs demonstrating ONE consistent pattern
          - A third incomplete pair (the second word is missing)
      3. Five multiple-choice options (A-E) with exactly one correct answer and four incorrect answers. Generate the options as well.
      4. A short detailed explanation highlighting the steps and why the correct answer is correct.

      Below is a summary of several letter-manipulation patterns from a textbook. Study these examples to understand the variety of ways words can be transformed.
      ## EXAMPLES FROM THE TEXTBOOK
      ### Example 1: Removing & Rearranging Letters
      • “mint” → “tin”: Remove the first letter “m”, then move the last letter "t" to the front → "tin"
      • “bows” → “sow”: Remove the first letter “b”, then move the last letter "s" to the front → "sow"
      • “hips” → “sip”: Remove the first letter “h”, then move the last letter "s" to the front → "sip"
      (For this, ensure that the first word in each pair MUST strictly be a valid FIVE-letter word and the second word in each pair MUST strictly be a valid THREE-letter word)

      ### Example 2: Simple Reversal (FOUR-letter word)
      • “emit” → “time”
      • “keep” → “peek”
      • “rats” → “star”
      (All are strictly reversed letter by letter.)

      Use these sample transformations to generate the questions.
      Ensure that all three pairs of words are formed using the same pattern.

    few_shot_examples: |
      ## EXAMPLE PUZZLE 1
      TITLE: Complete a Word Pair

      INSTRUCTIONS:
      Find the word that completes the third pair of words so that it follows the same pattern as the first two pairs.

      marks arm   ready ear   glove (?)

      Which of the following is the missing word?
      A) gel
      B) vel
      C) goy
      D) vex
      E) log <-- Correct

      DETAILED EXPLANATION:
      The pattern is to remove the last two letters, then move the first letter to end of the word
      • “marks” → “arm”: Remove the last two letters “ks”, then move “m” to the end of “ar” → “arm”
      • “ready” → “ear”: Remove the last two letters “dy”, then move “r” to the end of “ea” → “ear”
      • “glove” → “log”: Remove the last two letters “ve”, then move “g” to the end of “lo” → “log”
 
    assignment: |
      Using any ONE of the textbook patterns (removing and rearranging letters, reversing) or a simple variant, create ONE new puzzle in the same format
      Ensure that the puzzle is consistent, with all of the word pairs following the same pattern (no mixing patterns).
      If you decide to go with the "removing and rearranging letters" pattern, ensure that first word in each pair MUST strictly be a valid FIVE-letter word and the second 
      word in each pair MUST strictly be a valid THREE-letter word.
      Ensure that ALL SIX words in the question are real words.

      Give the output in the following json string format, escaping all the double quotes inside strings:

      (For this, the first word in each pair must be a valid EIGHT-letter word, and the second word must be a valid FOUR-letter word.)

      Transformation Rules:
      - The transformation must involve a consistent letter selection and/or rearrangement pattern across all three word pairs.
      - The positions chosen for extraction can vary (e.g., 1st, 4th, 6th, 8th in one puzzle, and 3rd, 5th, 7th, last in another), as long as 
      the same positions are applied consistently across all three pairs.
      - The first word in each pair must be exactly 8 letters long, and the second word must be exactly 4 letters long.

      EIGHT-letter word and the second word in each pair MUST strictly be a valid FOUR-letter word. Positions chosen for extraction can vary,
      as long as it is consistent across ALL three pairs. Ensure that there is a rearrangment of letters.
      Every word in the question must be a real word.

      Give the output in the following json string format, escaping all the double quotes inside strings:
      {
          "question_text": TITLE and INSTRUCTIONS section. List all the options as well WITHOUT identifying which is the correct answer.
          "correct_answer": correct option LETTER
          "answer_format": "multiple_choice"
          "explanation": DETAILED EXPLANATION section
          "distractors": ["list of incorrect option LETTERS (strictly 4)"]
          "set": [given word pair 1, given word pair 2, word pair 3 replaced with the correct answer] -> length = 6
      }
